# BERT-Chatbot

### Project Description

This chatbot answers questions related to Data Science from Wikipedia articles. The model was built and trained using 
Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), which is one of the most powerful NLP aglorithms out there.
The Q&A model had been built and trained by Andr√© Macedo Farias and his colleagues and can be loaded easily into your working
environment. The additions I had to this, were the webscraping and data preprocessing steps needed to suit this model.

One could easily change the URLs in the codes and use the bot answer different questions from whatever scrapped data you have.
